Hello!

I am the founder of [SimpleX Chat](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#readme) - the first (and the only?) messaging and application platform operating without user identifiers of any kind, not even random numbers are used to identify user profiles - it is 100% private by design!

SimpleX Chat is the next generation of decentralized communications, NOT based on crypto-currencies for a change. You can start using our private messaging apps for terminal, iOS and Android today - install the app, join our [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimpleXChat/) and support us with [donations](https://github.com/sponsors/simplex-chat)!

You can connect to me and ask any questions via SimpleX Chat app by scanning the QR code below or by using [this link](https://simplex.chat/contact#/?v=1&smp=smp%3A%2F%2Fu2dS9sG8nMNURyZwqASV4yROM28Er0luVTx5X1CsMrU%3D%40smp4.simplex.im%2FKBCmxJ3-lEjpWLPPkI6OWPk-YJneU5uY%23%2F%3Fv%3D1%26dh%3DMCowBQYDK2VuAyEAtixHJWDXvYWcoe-77vIfjvI6XWEuzUsapMS9nVHP_Go%253D%26srv%3Do5vmywmrnaxalvz6wi3zicyftgio6psuvyniis6gco6bp6ekl4cqj4id.onion).

I also created [Ajv data validation library](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv#readme) - it is used by millions of JavaScript applications and has ~300m monthly downloads on npm.
