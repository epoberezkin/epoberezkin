Hello!

I am the founder of [SimpleX Chat](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#readme) - the first (and the only?) messaging and application platform operating without user identifiers of any kind, not even random numbers are used to identify user profiles - it is 100% private by design!

SimpleX Chat is the next generation of decentralized communications, NOT based on crypto-currencies for a change. You can start using our private messaging apps for terminal, iOS and Android today - install the app, join our [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimpleXChat/) and support us with [donations](https://github.com/sponsors/simplex-chat)!

You can connect to me and ask any questions via SimpleX Chat app by scanning the QR code below or by using [this link](https://smp4.simplex.im/a#FURXht_fnIehvngJnjrz-2HU0ogCYdEhCVhj6HQmLYk) (you need SimpleX Chat v6.3.3+).

I also created [Ajv data validation library](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv#readme) - it is used by millions of JavaScript applications and has ~300m monthly downloads on npm.
